STATEMENT ΟΝ nupt-tome iMAGES

This reei of microfiim contains materiai
which has paper color changes, stainS, or
illustrations (some of which may appear ori
peges mixed with printed text). in order to

ensure that aii text arici illustrations are ,
lemme, exposure settinqs must be changed.

Therefore, when text and illustrations exist
iri a sinqie' image or when materiai
bacquourids differ, such frames may need
to be exposed twice.

The first exposure reflects the camera
operator’ s best effort to capture the majority
of trie text; the second exposure reflects the

camera operator’s best effert to capture

iliustrative materiai or the remaining text. it
is hoped that this practice witi result in a
microfiim product that fuiiy serves the needs
of most researchers
